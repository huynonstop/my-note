# Creational

 These patterns are designed for class instantiation. They can be either class-creation patterns or object-creational patterns.

## Singleton

Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.

```js
class SingletonClass {
    constructor(name = "") {
        if (!!SingletonClass.instance) {
            return SingletonClass.instance;
        }

        SingletonClass.instance = this;

        this.name = name;

        return this;
    }

    static getInstance() {
        return SingletonClass.instance;
    }
}
```

## Factory

Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

A Factory Method creates new objects as instructed by the client. One way to create objects in JavaScript is by invoking a constructor function with the new operator. There are situations however, where the client does not, or should not, know which one of several candidate objects to instantiate. The Factory Method allows the client to delegate object creation while still retaining control over which type to instantiate.

The key objective of the Factory Method is extensibility. Factory Methods are frequently used in applications that manage, maintain, or manipulate collections of objects that are different but at the same time have many characteristics (i.e. methods and properties) in common. An example would be a collection of documents with a mix of Xml documents, Pdf documents, and Rtf documents.

![Diagram JavaScript Factory Method Design Pattern](assets/DesignParttern/javascript-factory-method.jpg)

```js
function Factory() {
    this.createEmployee = function (type) {
        var employee;
 
        if (type === "fulltime") {
            employee = new FullTime();
        } else if (type === "parttime") {
            employee = new PartTime();
        } else if (type === "temporary") {
            employee = new Temporary();
        } else if (type ===
                   "contractor") {
            employee = new Contractor();
        }
 
        employee.type = type;
 
        employee.say = function () {
            log.add(this.type + ": rate " + this.hourly + "/hour");
        }
 
        return employee;
    }
}
 
var FullTime = function () {
    this.hourly = "$12";
};
 
var PartTime = function () {
    this.hourly = "$11";
};
 
var Temporary = function () {
    this.hourly = "$10";
};
 
var Contractor = function () {
    this.hourly = "$15";
};
```

## Abstract Factory

Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

An Abstract Factory creates objects that are related by a common theme. In object-oriented programming a Factory is an object that creates other objects. An Abstract Factory has abstracted out a theme which is shared by the newly created objects.

Suppose we have two Abstract Factories whose task it is to create page controls, such as, buttons, textboxes, radio buttons, and listboxes. One is the Light Factory which creates controls that are white and the other the Dark Factory which creates controls that are black. Both Factories creates the same types of controls, but they differ in color, which is their common theme. This is an implementation of the Abstract Factory pattern.

Over time the Abstract Factory and Factory Method patterns have merged into a more general pattern called Factory. A Factory is simply an object that creates other objects.

You may be wondering why you would want to leave the responsibility of the construction of objects to others rather than simply calling a constructor function with the new keyword directly. The reason is that that constructor functions are limited in their control over the overall creation process and sometimes you will need to hand over control to a factory that has broader knowledge.

This includes scenarios in which the creation process involves object caching, sharing or re-using of objects, complex logic, or applications that maintain object and type counts, and objects that interact with different resources or devices. If your application needs more control over the object creation process, consider using a Factory.

# Structural

These patterns are designed with regard to a class's structure and composition. The main goal of most of these patterns is to increase the functionality of the class(es) involved, without changing much of its composition.

## Composite

Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

The Composite pattern allows the creation of objects with properties that are primitive items or a collection of objects. Each item in the collection can hold other collections themselves, creating deeply nested structures.

A tree control is a perfect example of a Composite pattern. The nodes of the tree either contain an individual object (leaf node) or a group of objects (a subtree of nodes).

All nodes in the Composite pattern share a common set of properties and methods which supports individual objects as well as object collections. This common interface greatly facilitates the design and construction of recursive algorithms that iterate over each object in the Composite collection.

## Flyweight

Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.

The Flyweight pattern conserves memory by sharing large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently. Shared flyweight objects are immutable, that is, they cannot be changed as they represent the characteristics that are shared with other objects.

Essentially Flyweight is an 'object normalization technique' in which common properties are factored out into shared flyweight objects. (Note: the idea is similar to data model normalization, a process in which the modeler attempts to minimize redundancy).

An example of the Flyweight Pattern is within the JavaScript engine itself which maintains a list of immutable strings that are shared across the application.

Other examples include characters and line-styles in a word processor, or 'digit receivers' in a public switched telephone network application. You will find flyweights mostly in utility type applications such as word processors, graphics programs, and network apps; they are less often used in data-driven business type applications.

# Behavioral

These patterns are designed depending on how one class communicates with others.

## Command

The Command pattern encapsulates actions as objects. Command objects allow for loosely coupled systems by separating the objects that issue a request from the objects that actually process the request. These requests are called events and the code that processes the requests are called event handlers.

Suppose you are building an application that supports the Cut, Copy, and Paste clipboard actions. These actions can be triggered in different ways throughout the app: by a menu system, a context menu (e.g. by right clicking on a textbox), or by a keyboard shortcut.

Command objects allow you to centralize the processing of these actions, one for each operation. So, you need only one Command for processing all Cut requests, one for all Copy requests, and one for all Paste requests.

Because commands centralize all processing, they are also frequently involved in handling Undo functionality for the entire application.

## Observer

The Observer pattern offers a subscription model in which objects subscribe to an event and get notified when the event occurs. This pattern is the cornerstone of event driven programming, including JavaScript. The Observer pattern facilitates good object-oriented design and promotes loose coupling.

When building web apps you end up writing many event handlers. Event handlers are functions that will be notified when a certain event fires. These notifications optionally receive an event argument with details about the event (for example the x and y position of the mouse at a click event).

The event and event-handler paradigm in JavaScript is the manifestation of the Observer design pattern. Another name for the Observer pattern is Pub/Sub, short for Publication/Subscription.

![Diagram JavaScript Observer Design Pattern](assets/DesignParttern/javascript-observer.jpg)

```js
  // each instance of the Observer class
  // starts with an empty array of things (observers)
  // that react to a state change
  constructor() {
    this.observers = [];
  }

  // add the ability to subscribe to a new object / DOM element
  // essentially, add something to the observers array
  subscribe(f) {
    this.observers.push(f);
  }

  // add the ability to unsubscribe from a particular object
  // essentially, remove something from the observers array
  unsubscribe(f) {
    this.observers = this.observers.filter(subscriber => subscriber !== f);
  }

  // update all subscribed objects / DOM elements
  // and pass some data to each of them
  notify(data) {
    this.observers.forEach(observer => observer(data));
  }
}

function Click() {
    this.handlers = [];  // observers
}
 
Click.prototype = {
 
    subscribe: function(fn) {
        this.handlers.push(fn);
    },
 
    unsubscribe: function(fn) {
        this.handlers = this.handlers.filter(
            function(item) {
                if (item !== fn) {
                    return item;
                }
            }
        );
    },
 
    fire: function(o, thisObj) {
        var scope = thisObj || window;
        this.handlers.forEach(function(item) {
            item.call(scope, o);
        });
    }
}
```

## Strategy

Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

The Strategy pattern encapsulates alternative algorithms (or strategies) for a particular task. It allows a method to be swapped out at runtime by any other method (strategy) without the client realizing it. Essentially, Strategy is a group of algorithms that are interchangeable.

Say we like to test the performance of different sorting algorithms to an array of numbers: shell sort, heap sort, bubble sort, quicksort, etc. Applying the Strategy pattern to these algorithms allows the test program to loop through all algorithms, simply by changing them at runtime and test each of these against the array. For Strategy to work all method signatures must be the same so that they can vary without the client program knowing about it.

In JavaScript the Strategy pattern is widely used as a plug-in mechanism when building extensible frameworks. This can be a very effective approach
